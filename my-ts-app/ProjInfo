The latest version of Next.js is 16.0.3, released on November 13, 2025.
This version, known as the Active LTS (Long-Term Support) release, was officially launched on October 21, 2025, bringing significant improvements to developer experience, routing, and caching.
Key features include the stable release of Turbopack as the default bundler, which offers up to 10x faster Fast Refresh and 2x to 5x faster production builds.
Next.js 16 also introduces Cache Components, a new programming model using the "use cache" directive to provide explicit control over caching for instant navigation.
The release includes enhanced routing with optimized navigation and prefetching, improved caching APIs with new updateTag() and refresh() functions, and built-in React Compiler support for automatic memoization.
Additionally, it ships with React 19.2, introducing features like View Transitions, useEffectEvent(), and the component.
The update also features a new proxy.ts file name for Node.js runtime middleware, replacing middleware.ts to clarify its purpose at the network edge.
Next.js 16 requires Node.js 20.9 or higher and TypeScript 5 or higher for compatibility.

// Route Handler (Next.js) --------------------------<<<<<
Yes, the Next.js App Router has API routes, but they are implemented using a new convention called Route Handlers.
Route Handlers are the direct equivalent of API Routes from the older Pages Router and are the recommended way
to handle backend logic within the app directory.

Example: Creating a GET Route Handler
To create a simple API endpoint at /api/hello, you would create a file at app/api/hello/route.ts (or .js).
typescript
// app/api/hello/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
// Handle the GET request
return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from the API!' }, { status: 200 });
}

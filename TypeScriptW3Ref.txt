TypeScript Tutorial -https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php

TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.

> > TypeScript Introduction

What is TypeScript? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

** TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it. **

Why should I use TypeScript? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

** TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code. **

How do I use TypeScript? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.
The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

TypeScript Exercises
TypeScript allows developers to add "types" to JavaScript.
JavaScript is a "losely" typed language.

TypeScript Compiler -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.

** TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs! **

Installing the Compiler ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

TypeScript has an official compiler which can be installed through npm.
Learn more about npm, and how to get started here: What is npm? "https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp"

Within your npm project, run the following command to install the compiler:

npm install typescript --save-dev

Which should give you an output similar to:
added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 2s
found 0 vulnerabilities

The compiler is installed in the node_modules directory and can be run with: npx tsc.
npx tsc

Which should give you an output similar to:
Version 4.5.5
tsc: The TypeScript Compiler - Version 4.5.5
Followed by a list of all the Common Commands.

Configuring the compiler ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

By default the TypeScript compiler will print a help message when run in an empty project.
The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:
npx tsc --init

Which should give you an output similar to:
Created a new tsconfig.json with:
TS
target: es2016
module: commonjs
strict: true
esModuleInterop: true
skipLibCheck: true
forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true
You can learn more at https://aka.ms/tsconfig.json

Here is an example of more things you could add to the tsconfig.json file:
{
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./build"
  }
}
You can open the file in an editor to add those options. This will configure the TypeScript compiler to transpile TypeScript files located in the src/ directory of your project, into JavaScript files in the build/ directory.

** This is one way to quickly get started with TypeScript. There are many other options available such as a create-react-app template, a node starter project, and a webpack plugin. **

Exercise:
The TypeScript compiler can be configured which file?
tsconfig.json

> > TypeScript Simple Types

TypeScript supports some simple types (primitives) you may know.

There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

boolean - true or false values
number - whole numbers and floating point values
string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"
There are also 2 less common primitives used in later versions of Javascript and TypeScript.

bigint - whole numbers and floating point values, but allows larger negative and positive numbers than the number type.
symbol are used to create a globally unique identifier.

Type Assignment -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:

> > > Explicit
> > > Implicit

Explicit Type -------- (_v_)
Explicit - writing out the type:

let firstName: string = "Dylan";
console.log(typeof firstName); // string

Explicit type assignment are easier to read and more intentional.

Implicit Type -------- (_v_)
Implicit - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:

let firstName = "Dylan";
console.log(typeof firstName); // string

Note: Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called infer.
Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to infer the value.
Implicit type assignment are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.

Error In Type Assignment ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --

TypeScript will throw an error if data types do not match.

Example
let firstName: string = "Dylan"; // type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type
console.log(firstName); // prog.ts(2,1): error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

Implicit type assignment would have made firstName less noticeable as a string, but both will throw an error:

Example
let firstName = "Dylan"; // inferred to type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type
console.log(firstName); // prog.ts(2,1): error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

JavaScript will not throw an error for mismatched types.

Unable to Infer ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

TypeScript may not always properly infer what the type of a variable may be. In such cases, it will set the type to any which disables type checking.

Example
// Implicit any as JSON.parse doesn't know what type of data it returns so it can be "any" thing...
const json = JSON.parse("55");

// Most expect json to be an object, but it can be a string or a number like this example
console.log(typeof json); // number

This behavior can be disabled by enabling noImplicitAny as an option in a TypeScript's project tsconfig.json.
That is a JSON config file for customizing how some of TypeScript behaves.

Note: you may see primitive types capitalized like Boolean.
boolean !== Boolean
For this tutorial just know to use the lower-cased values, the upper-case ones are for very specific circumstances.

Exercise: ----------------(\v/)--
There are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
implicit
explicit

Create a "firstName" variable, string type using Implicit type:
let firstName = "Dylan"

Create a "firstName" variable, string type using Explicit type:
let firstName: string = "Dylan"

> > TypeScript Special Types

TypeScript has special types that may not refer to any specific type of data.

Type: any ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --

any is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.

The example below does not use any and will throw an error:

Example without any -------- (_v_)
let u = true;
u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
Math.round(u); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

Setting any to the special type any disables type checking:

Example with any ----------- (_v_)
let v: any = true;
v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
Math.round(v); // no error as it can be "any" type

Extra Examples +++

let u = true;
u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
u.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Property 'runANonExistentMethod' does not exist on type 'boolean'.
console.log(Math.round(u)); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
// Console :-
prog.ts(2,7): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
prog.ts(3,9): error TS2339: Property 'runANonExistentMethod' does not exist on type 'boolean'.
prog.ts(4,18): error TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

let v: any = true;
v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
console.log(Math.round(v)); // no error as it can be "any" type
// Console :-
NaN

**----- any can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able provide type safety, and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion, will not work. Remember, it should be avoided at "any" cost... -----**

Type: unknown --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.

TypeScript will prevent unknown types from being used, as shown in the below example:

let w: unknown = 1;
w = "string"; // no error

w = {
  runANonExistentMethod: () => {
    console.log("I think therefore I am");
  }
} as { runANonExistentMethod: () => void }

// How can we avoid the error for the code commented out below when we don't know the type?
// w.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.

if(typeof w === 'object' && w !== null) {
(w as { runANonExistentMethod: Function }).runANonExistentMethod();
}
// Although we have to cast multiple times we can do a check in the if to secure our type and have a safer casting

// Console :-
I think therefore I am

Compare the example above to the previous example, with any.

**----- unknown is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it. Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type. -----**

Type: never ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --

never effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.

let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
Console :-
prog.ts(1,5): error TS2322: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.

**----- never is rarely used, especially by itself, its primary use is in advanced generics. -----**

Type: undefined & null ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --

undefined and null are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives undefined and null respectively.

let y: undefined = undefined;
console.log(typeof y);

let z: null = null;
console.log(typeof z);

// Console :-
undefined
object

**----- These types don't have much use unless strictNullChecks is enabled in the tsconfig.json file. -----**

Exercise: ----------------(\v/)--
Create an empty "myVar" variable, and disable type checking:
let myVar: any;

Create an empty "myVar" variable, and specify it should be an unknown type:
let myVar: unknown;

> > TypeScript Arrays \*\*\*\* --( Compiler : https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/trytypescript.php?filename=demo_editor )--

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing arrays.

Read more about arrays in our JavaScript Array chapter. >> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp

const names: string[] = [];
names.push("Dylan"); // no error
names.push(3); // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
console.log(names);

Console :-
prog.ts(3,15): error TS2345: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

Readonly ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --
The readonly keyword can prevent arrays from being changed.

Example
const names: readonly string[] = ["Dylan"];
names.push("Jack"); // Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
// try removing the readonly modifier and see if it works?
console.log(names);

Console :-
prog.ts(2,13): error TS2339: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.

Type Inference ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --
TypeScript can infer the type of an array if it has values.

Example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // inferred to type number[]
numbers.push(4); // no error
// comment line below out to see the successful assignment
numbers.push("2"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
console.log(numbers);
let head: number = numbers[0]; // no error
console.log(head);

Console :-
prog.ts(4,20): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

Exercise: ----------------(\v/)--
Prevent the array from being changed:
const names: readonly string[] = ["Dylan"];

> > TypeScript Tuples

Typed Arrays -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.
Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.
To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

Example
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
console.log(ourTuple);

Console :-
[ 5, false, 'Coding God was here' ]

-- As you can see we have a number, boolean and a string. But what happens if we try to set them in the wrong order:

Example
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize incorrectly throws an error
ourTuple = [false, 'Coding God was mistaken', 5];
console.log(ourTuple);

Console :-
prog.ts(4,21): error TS2322: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number'.
prog.ts(4,28): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
prog.ts(4,55): error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

**----- Even though we have a boolean, string, and number the order matters in our tuple and will throw an error. -----**

Readonly Tuple -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
A good practice is to make your tuple readonly.
Tuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:

Example
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
// We have no type safety in our tuple for indexes 3+
ourTuple.push('Something new and wrong');
console.log(ourTuple);

Console :-
[ 5, false, 'Coding God was here', 'Something new and wrong' ]

-- You see the new valueTuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:

Example
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
// We have no type safety in our tuple for indexes 3+
ourTuple.push('Something new and wrong');
// instead use our readonly tuple
const ourReadonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [5, true, 'The Real Coding God'];
// throws error as it is readonly.
ourReadonlyTuple.push('Coding God took a day off');

Console :-
prog.ts(4,18): error TS2339: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly [number, boolean, string]'.

-- To learn more about access modifiers like readonly go to our section on them here: TypeScript Classes -https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_classes.php.

**----- If you have ever used React before you have worked with tuples more than likely. -----**
**----- useState returns a tuple of the value and a setter function. -----**
**----- const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Dylan') is a common example. -----**
**----- Because of the structure we know our first value in our list will be a certain value type in this case a string and the second value a function. -----**

Named Tuples ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
Named tuples allow us to provide context for our values at each index.

Example
const graph: [x: number, y: number] = [55.2, 41.3];

**----- Named tuples provide more context for what our index values represent. -----**

Destructuring Tuples -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
Since tuples are arrays we can also destructure them.

Example
const graph: [number, number] = [55.2, 41.3];
const [x, y] = graph;

-- To review destructuring check it out here. -https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_destructuring.asp

Exercise:
The order of value types does not matter for Tuples:
False
Define ourTuple as string and boolean, in that order:
let ourTuple: [string, boolean];

> > TypeScript Object Types

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing objects.

Read more about objects in our JavaScript Objects chapter. -https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp

Example
const car: { type: string, model: string, year: number } = {
  type: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2009
};
console.log(car);

Console :-
{ type: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2009 }

**----- Object types like this can also be written separately, and even be reused, look at interfaces for more details. -----** >> https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_aliases_and_interfaces.php

Type Inference ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
TypeScript can infer the types of properties based on their values.

Example
const car = {
  type: "Toyota",
};
car.type = "Ford"; // no error
car.type = 2; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
console.log(car);

Console :-
prog.ts(5,7): error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

Optional Properties -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- v --
Optional properties are properties that don't have to be defined in the object definition.

Example without an optional property
const car: { type: string, mileage: number } = { // Error: Property 'mileage' is missing in type '{ type: string; }' but required in type '{ type: string; mileage: number; }'.
  type: "Toyota",
};
car.mileage = 2000;

Example with an optional property
const car: { type: string, mileage?: number } = { // no error
  type: "Toyota"
};
car.mileage = 2000;
console.log(car);

Console :-
{ type: 'Toyota', mileage: 2000 }

Index Signatures ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ v --
Index signatures can be used for objects without a defined list of properties.

Example
const nameAgeMap: { [index: string]: number } = {};
nameAgeMap.Jack = 25; // no error
nameAgeMap.Mark = "Fifty"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
console.log(nameAgeMap);

Console :-
prog.ts(3,7): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

**----- Index signatures like this one can also be expressed with utility types like Record<string, number>. -----**

// Learn more about utility types like this in our TypeScript Utility Types chapter.

Exercise
Add the correct types for the object below:

const car: { type: string, model: string, year: number } = {
  type: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2009
};

Specify that the second property, called model, should be optional:
const car: { type: string, model?: string } = {
  type: "Toyota"
};

> > TypeScript Enums

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
Enums come in two flavors string and numeric. Lets start with numeric.

Numeric Enums - Default -------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
By default, enums will initialize the first value to 0 and add 1 to each additional value:

Example
enum CardinalDirections {
  North,
  East,
  South,
  West
};  
let currentDirection = CardinalDirections.North;
// North is the first value so it logs '0'
console.log(currentDirection);
// throws error when commented in as 'North' is not a valid enum
// currentDirection = 'North';
// Error: "North" is not assignable to type 'CardinalDirections'.

Console :-
0

Numeric Enums - Initialized ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
You can set the value of the first numeric enum and have it auto increment from that:

Example
enum CardinalDirections {
  North = 1,
  East,
  South,
  West
};
// logs 1 since we initialized the first value to something other than '0'
console.log(CardinalDirections.North);
// logs 4 as it continued on from the initial '1' value
console.log(CardinalDirections.West);

Console :-
1
4

Numeric Enums - Fully Initialized ----------------------------------------------------------------------v--
You can assign unique number values for each enum value. Then the values will not incremented automatically:

Example
enum StatusCodes {
  NotFound = 404,
  Success = 200,
  Accepted = 202,
  BadRequest = 400
};
// logs 404
console.log(StatusCodes.NotFound);
// logs 200
console.log(StatusCodes.Success);

Console :-
404
200

String Enums -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Enums can also contain strings. This is more common than numeric enums, because of their readability and intent.

Example
enum CardinalDirections {
  North = "North",
  East = "East",
  South = "South",
  West = "West"
};
// logs "North"
console.log(CardinalDirections.North);
// logs "West"
console.log(CardinalDirections.West);

Console :-
North
West

**----- Technically, you can mix and match string and numeric enum values, but it is recommended not to do so. -----**

Exercise
Create an enum called myEnum, with 2 constants (myFirstConst, mySecondConst) with default values:

enum myEnum {
  myFirstConst,
  mySecondConst
};

Create an enum called myEnum, with 2 constants (myFirstConst, mySecondConst) with the string values "first" and "second":

enum myEnum {
  myFirstConst = "first",
  mySecondConst = "second",
};

> >  TypeScript Type Aliases and Interfaces

TypeScript allows types to be defined separately from the variables that use them.
Aliases and Interfaces allows types to be easily shared between different variables/objects.

Type Aliases -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Type Aliases allow defining types with a custom name (an Alias).
Type Aliases can be used for primitives like string or more complex types such as objects and arrays:

Example
// Try creating a new Car using the alias provided
type CarYear = number;
type CarType = string;
type CarModel = string;
type Car = {
  year: CarYear,
  type: CarType,
  model: CarModel
};

const carYear: CarYear = 2001
const carType: CarType = "Toyota"
const carModel: CarModel = "Corolla"
const car: Car = {
  year: carYear,
  type: carType,
  model: carModel
};

console.log(car);

Console :-
{ year: 2001, type: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla' }

Interfaces --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Interfaces are similar to type aliases, except they only apply to object types.

Example
// Try creating a new interface using it below
interface Rectangle {
  height: number,
  width: number
};

const rectangle: Rectangle = {
  height: 20,
  width: 10
};

console.log(rectangle);

Console :-
{ height: 20, width: 10 }

Extending Interfaces ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Interfaces can extend each other's definition.

**----- Extending an interface means you are creating a new interface with the same properties as the original, plus something new. -----**

Example
// Try creating a new interface and extending it like below
interface Rectangle {
  height: number,
  width: number
}

interface ColoredRectangle extends Rectangle {
  color: string
}

const coloredRectangle: ColoredRectangle = {
  height: 20,
  width: 10,
  color: "red"
};

console.log(coloredRectangle);

Console :-
{ height: 20, width: 10, color: 'red' }

Exercise

Create a Type Alias for a string, called carType:
type carType = string

Create an interface called myInterface, with the property myProp as a string:
interface myInterface {
  myProp :string
}

Extend the myInterface interface from last exercise, and add a property myExtProp as a number:
interface myExtInterface extends myInterface {
  myExtProp :number
}

> > TypeScript Union Types
Union types are used when a value can be more than a single type.
Such as when a property would be string or number.

Union | (OR) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Using the | we are saying our parameter is a string or number:

Example
function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
  console.log(`My status code is ${code}.`)
}
printStatusCode(404);
printStatusCode('404');

Console :-
My status code is 404.
My status code is 404.

Union Type Errors -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Note: you need to know what your type is when union types are being used to avoid type errors:

Example
function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
  console.log(`My status code is ${code.toUpperCase()}.`) // error: Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'. Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'
}
Console :-
prog.ts(2,51): error TS2339: Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.

In our example we are having an issue invoking toUpperCase() as its a string method and number doesn't have access to it.

Exercise
Specify that the parameter "myVar" for the function can be either string or number:

function myFunc(myVar: string | number) {
  console.log(myVar)
}


> > TypeScript Functions

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing function parameters and return values.
Read more about functions here -https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp

Return Type -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--

The type of the value returned by the function can be explicitly defined.

Example
// the `: number` here specifies that this function returns a number
function getTime(): number {
  return new Date().getTime();
}
console.log(getTime());

Console :-
1648464745471

**----- If no return type is defined, TypeScript will attempt to infer it through the types of the variables or expressions returned. -----**

Void Return Type -----------------------------------------------------------------------v--

The type void can be used to indicate a function doesn't return any value.

Example
function printHello(): void {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
printHello();

Console :-
Hello!

Parameters ------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Function parameters are typed with a similar syntax as variable declarations.

Example
function multiply(a: number, b: number) {
  return a * b;
}
console.log(multiply(2,5))

Console :-
10

**----- If no parameter type is defined, TypeScript will default to using any, unless additional type information is available as shown in the Default Parameters and Type Alias sections below. -----**

Optional Parameters ---------------------------------------------------------------------v--
By default TypeScript will assume all parameters are required, but they can be explicitly marked as optional.

Example
// the `?` operator here marks parameter `c` as optional
function add(a: number, b: number, c?: number) {
  return a + b + (c || 0);
}
console.log(add(2,5))

Console :-
7

Default Parameters ----------------------------------------------------------------------v--
For parameters with default values, the default value goes after the type annotation:

Example
function pow(value: number, exponent: number = 10) {
  return value ** exponent;
}
console.log(pow(10));

Console :-
10000000000

TypeScript can also infer the type from the default value.

Named Parameters ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Typing named parameters follows the same pattern as typing normal parameters.

Example
function divide({ dividend, divisor }: { dividend: number, divisor: number }) {
  return dividend / divisor;
}
console.log(divide({dividend: 10, divisor: 2}));

Console :-
5

Rest Parameters ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Rest parameters can be typed like normal parameters, but the type must be an array as rest parameters are always arrays.

Example
function add(a: number, b: number, ...rest: number[]) {
  return a + b + rest.reduce((p, c) => p + c, 0);
}
console.log(add(10,10,10,10,10));

Console :-
50

Type Alias -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Function types can be specified separately from functions with type aliases.
These types are written similarly to arrow functions, read more about arrow functions here.
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp

Example
type Negate = (value: number) => number;
// in this function, the parameter `value` automatically gets assigned the type `number` from the type `Negate`
const negateFunction: Negate = (value) => value * -1;
console.log(negateFunction(10));

Console :-
-10

Exercise
Create a function that returns the string "Learning is Fun!", with the return type explicitly defined:
function myFunc(): string {
 return "Learning is Fun!";
}

Create a function that specifically does not return a value:
function myFunc(): void {
 return "Learning is Fun!";
}

Create a function with 2 parameters (myVar1 and myVar2), that are both strings:
function myFunc(myVar1 :string, myVar2:string) {
  return(myVar1 + myVar2);
}

Create a function with 2 parameters (myVar1 and myVar2,in that order), that are both strings.
Specify that myVar2 should be optional:
function myFunc(myVar1 :string, myVar2? :string) {
  return(myVar1 + (myVar2 || ""));

> > TypeScript Casting

There are times when working with types where it's necessary to override the type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by a library.
Casting is the process of overriding a type.

Casting with as -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the as keyword, which will directly change the type of the given variable.

Example
let x: unknown = 'hello';
console.log((x as string).length);

Console :-
5

**----- Casting doesn't actually change the type of the data within the variable, for example the following code will not work as expected since the variable x is still holds a number. -----**

let x: unknown = 4;
console.log((x as string).length); 
// prints undefined since numbers don't have a length

**----- TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck casts to prevent casts that don't seem correct, 
for example the following will throw a type error since TypeScript knows casting a string to a number doesn't makes sense without converting the data: -----**

console.log((4 as string).length); 
// Error: Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.

The Force casting section below covers how to override this.

Casting with <> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Using <> works the same as casting with as.

Example
let x: unknown = 'hello';
console.log((<string>x).length);

Console :-
5

**----- This type of casting will not work with TSX, such as when working on React files. -----**

Force casting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
To override type errors that TypeScript may throw when casting, first cast to unknown, then to the target type.

Example
let x = 'hello';
console.log(((x as unknown) as number).length); // x is not actually a number so this will return undefined

Console :-
prog.ts(2,40): error TS2339: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'number'.

Exercise:
Cast the "unknown" variable myVar as a string, using the as keyword:
let myVar: unknown = "Hello World";
console.log((myVar as string).length);

Cast the "unknown" variable myVar as a string, using < >:
let myVar: unknown = "Hello world!";
console.log((<string>myVar).length);


> > TypeScript Classes
TypeScript adds types and visibility modifiers to JavaScript classes.
Learn more about JavaScript classes here. -https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp

Members: Types -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
The members of a class (properties & methods) are typed using type annotations, similar to variables.

Example
class Person {
  name: string;
}   
const person = new Person();
person.name = "Jane";
console.log(person);

Console :-
Person { name: 'Jane' }

Members: Visibility ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Class members also be given special modifiers which affect visibility.

There are three main visibility modifiers in TypeScript.
public - (default) allows access to the class member from anywhere
private - only allows access to the class member from within the class
protected - allows access to the class member from itself and any classes that inherit it, which is covered in the inheritance section below

Example
class Person {
  private name: string;

  public constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}
const person = new Person("Jane");
console.log(person.getName()); // person.name isn't accessible from outside the class since it's private

Console :-
Jane

**----- The this keyword in a class usually refers to the instance of the class. Read more about this here. -https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp -----**

Parameter Properties ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
TypeScript provides a convenient way to define class members in the constructor, by adding a visibility modifiers to the parameter.

Example
class Person {
  // name is a private member variable
  public constructor(private name: string) {}

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}
const person = new Person("Jane");
console.log(person.getName());

Console :-
Jane

Readonly ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Similar to arrays, the readonly keyword can prevent class members from being changed.

Example
class Person {
  private readonly name: string;

  public constructor(name: string) {
    // name cannot be changed after this initial definition, which has to be either at it's declaration or in the constructor.
    this.name = name;
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}     
const person = new Person("Jane");
console.log(person.getName());

Console :-
Jane

Inheritance: Implements ---------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Interfaces (covered here -https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_aliases_and_interfaces.php) 
can be used to define the type a class must follow through the implements keyword.

Example
interface Shape {
  getArea: () => number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  public constructor(protected readonly width: number, protected readonly height: number) {}

  public getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const myRect = new Rectangle(10,20);
console.log(myRect.getArea());

Console :-
200

**----- A class can implement multiple interfaces by listing each one after implements, separated by a comma like so: class Rectangle implements Shape, Colored { -----**

Inheritance: Extends ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Classes can extend each other through the extends keyword. A class can only extends one other class.

Example

interface Shape {
  getArea: () => number;
}
      
class Rectangle implements Shape {
  public constructor(protected readonly width: number, protected readonly height: number) {}

  public getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
      
class Square extends Rectangle {
  public constructor(width: number) {
    super(width, width);
  }
  // getArea gets inherited from Rectangle
}

const mySq = new Square(20);
console.log(mySq.getArea());

Console :-
400

Override -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
When a class extends another class, it can replace the members of the parent class with the same name.
Newer versions of TypeScript allow explicitly marking this with the override keyword.

Example

interface Shape {
  getArea: () => number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  // using protected for these members allows access from classes that extend from this class, such as Square
  public constructor(protected readonly width: number, protected readonly height: number) {}

  public getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  public toString(): string {
    return `Rectangle[width=${this.width}, height=${this.height}]`;
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  public constructor(width: number) {
    super(width, width);
  }

  // this toString replaces the toString from Rectangle
  public override toString(): string {
    return `Square[width=${this.width}]`;
  }
}

const mySq = new Square(20);
console.log(mySq.toString());

Console :-
Square[width=20]

**----- By default the override keyword is optional when overriding a method, and only helps to prevent accidentally overriding a method that does not exist. 
Use the setting noImplicitOverride to force it to be used when overriding. -----**

Abstract Classes -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Classes can be written in a way that allows them to be used as a base class for other classes without having to implement all the members. 
This is done by using the abstract keyword. Members that are left unimplemented also use the abstract keyword.

Example

abstract class Polygon {
  public abstract getArea(): number;

  public toString(): string {
    return `Polygon[area=${this.getArea()}]`;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Polygon {
  public constructor(protected readonly width: number, protected readonly height: number) {
    super();
  }

  public getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const myRect = new Rectangle(10,20);
console.log(myRect.getArea());

Console :-
200

**----- Abstract classes cannot be directly instantiated, as they do not have all their members implemented. -----**


Exercise

Specify that Person.name can only be accessed within the class, but that the method Person.getName() can be accessed anywhere:

class Person {
private name: string;

 public constructor(name: string) {
  this.name = name;
 }

 public getName(): string {
  return this.name;
 }
}


> > TypeScript Basic Generics

Generics allow creating 'type variables' which can be used to create classes, functions & type aliases that don't need to explicitly define the types that they use.
Generics makes it easier to write reusable code.

Functions -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Generics with functions help make more generalized methods which more accurately represent the types used and returned.

Example
function createPair<S, T>(v1: S, v2: T): [S, T] {
  return [v1, v2];
}
console.log(createPair<string, number>('hello', 42)); // ['hello', 42]

Console :-
['hello', 42]

**----- TypeScript can also infer the type of the generic parameter from the function parameters. -----**

Classes -----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Generics can be used to create generalized classes, like Map. -https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_maps.asp

Example
class NamedValue<T> {
  private _value: T | undefined;

  constructor(private name: string) {}

  public setValue(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
  }

  public getValue(): T | undefined {
    return this._value;
  }

  public toString(): string {
    return `${this.name}: ${this._value}`;
  }
}
      
const value = new NamedValue<number>('myNumber');

value.setValue(10);

console.log(value.toString()); // myNumber: 10

Console :- 
myNumber: 10

**----- TypeScript can also infer the type of the generic parameter if it's used in a constructor parameter. -----**

Type Aliases -------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Generics in type aliases allow creating types that are more reusable.

Example
type Wrapped<T> = { value: T };
const wrappedValue: Wrapped<number> = { value: 10 };

**----- This also works with interfaces with the following syntax: interface Wrapped<T> { -----**

Default Value ------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Generics can be assigned default values which apply if no other value is specified or inferred.

Example

class NamedValue<T = string> {
  private _value: T | undefined;

  constructor(private name: string) {}

  public setValue(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
  }

  public getValue(): T | undefined {
    return this._value;
  }

  public toString(): string {
    return `${this.name}: ${this._value}`;
  }
}

let value = new NamedValue('myNumber');
value.setValue('myValue');
console.log(value.toString()); // myNumber: myValue

Extends ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Constraints can be added to generics to limit what's allowed. The constraints make it possible to rely on a more specific 
type when using the generic type.

Example

function createLoggedPair<S extends string | number, T extends string | number>(v1: S, v2: T): [S, T] {
  console.log(`creating pair: v1='${v1}', v2='${v2}'`);
  return [v1, v2];
}

**----- This can be combined with a default value. -----**

Exercise

Complete the Generic:

function createPair <typeX, typeY> (x: typeX, y: typeY): [typeX, typeY] {
 return [x, y];
}
console.log(createPair<string, number>('Meaning', 42));

> > TypeScript Utility Types

TypeScript comes with a large number of types that can help with some common type manipulation, usually referred to as utility types.
This chapter covers the most popular utility types.

Partial ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Partial changes all the properties in an object to be optional.

Example
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

let pointPart: Partial<Point> = {}; // `Partial` allows x and y to be optional
pointPart.x = 10;

console.log(pointPart);

Console :-
{ x: 10 }

Required ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Required changes all the properties in an object to be required.

Example
interface Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  mileage?: number;
}

let myCar: Required<Car> = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'Focus',
  mileage: 12000 // `Required` forces mileage to be defined
};

console.log(myCar);

Console :-
{ make: 'Ford', model: 'Focus', mileage: 12000 }

Record ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Record is a shortcut to defining an object type with a specific key type and value type.

Example
const nameAgeMap: Record<string, number> = {
  'Alice': 21,
  'Bob': 25
};

console.log(nameAgeMap);

Console :-
{ Alice: 21, Bob: 25 }

**----- Record<string, number> is equivalent to { [key: string]: number } -----**

Omit ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Omit removes keys from an object type.

Example
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  location?: string;
}
    
const bob: Omit<Person, 'age' | 'location'> = {
  name: 'Bob'
  // `Omit` has removed age and location from the type and they can't be defined here
};

console.log(bob);

Console :-
{ name: 'Bob' }

Pick ----------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Pick removes all but the specified keys from an object type.

Example
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  location?: string;
}
            
const bob: Pick<Person, 'name'> = {
  name: 'Bob'
  // `Pick` has only kept name, so age and location were removed from the type and they can't be defined here
};

console.log(bob);

Console :-
{ name: 'Bob' }

Exclude -------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Exclude removes types from a union.

Example
type Primitive = string | number | boolean
const value: Exclude<Primitive, string> = true; // a string cannot be used here since Exclude removed it from the type.
console.log(typeof value);

Console :-
boolean

ReturnType -----------------------------------------------------------------------v--
ReturnType extracts the return type of a function type.

Example
type PointGenerator = () => { x: number; y: number; };
const point: ReturnType<PointGenerator> = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20
};

Parameters -----------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Parameters extracts the parameter types of a function type as an array.

Example
type PointPrinter = (p: { x: number; y: number; }) => void;
const point: Parameters<PointPrinter>[0] = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20
};

Readonly -------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
Readonly is used to create a new type where all properties are readonly, meaning they cannot be modified once assigned a value.

**----- Keep in mind TypeScript will prevent this at compile time, but in theory since it is compiled down to JavaScript you can still override a readonly property. -----**

Example
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const person: Readonly<Person> = {
    name: "Dylan",
    age: 35,
};

person.name = 'Israel'; // prog.ts(11,8): error TS2540: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

Console :-
prog.ts(11,8): error TS2540: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

Exercise:
Declare an object kindPerson from the Person interface, where all the properties are optional:
interface Person {
    age: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}          
let kindPerson: Partial<Person> = {};

Declare an object kindPerson from the Person interface, where all the properties are required.
interface Person {
    age: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName?: string;
}          
let kindPerson: Required<Person> {
    age: 1800,
    firstName: "Santa",
    lastName: "Claus"
};

Complete the sentence:
Record<string, number> is equivalent to { [key: string]: number }

> > TypeScript Keyof

**----- keyof is a keyword in TypeScript which is used to extract the key type from an object type. -----**

keyof with explicit keys ---------------------------------------------------------v--
When used on an object type with explicit keys, keyof creates a union type with those keys.

Example 

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// `keyof Person` here creates a union type of "name" and "age", other strings will not be allowed
function printPersonProperty(person: Person, property: keyof Person) {
  console.log(`Printing person property ${property}: "${person[property]}"`);
}

let person = {
  name: "Max",
  age: 27
};

printPersonProperty(person, "name"); // Printing person property name: "Max"s

Console :-
Printing person property name: "Max"

keyof with index signatures ------------------------------------------------------v--
keyof can also be used with index signatures to extract the index type.

Example 

type StringMap = { [key: string]: unknown };
// `keyof StringMap` resolves to `string` here
function createStringPair(property: keyof StringMap, value: string): StringMap {
  return { [property]: value };
}

> > TypeScript Null & Undefined

TypeScript has a powerful system to deal with null or undefined values.

**----- By default null and undefined handling is disabled, and can be enabled by setting strictNullChecks to true.

The rest of this page applies for when strictNullChecks is enabled.-----**

Types ---------------------------------------------------------------------------v--
null and undefined are primitive types and can be used like other types, such as string.

Example

let value: string | undefined | null = null;
console.log(typeof value);

value = 'hello';
console.log(typeof value);

value = undefined;
console.log(typeof value);

Console :-
object
string
undefined

**----- When strictNullChecks is enabled, TypeScript requires values to be set unless undefined is explicitly added to the type. -----**

Optional Chaining ---------------------------------------------------------------v--
Optional Chaining is a JavaScript feature that works well with TypeScript's null handling. 
It allows accessing properties on an object, that may or may not exist, with a compact syntax. 
It can be used with the ?. operator when accessing properties.

Example

interface House {
  sqft: number;
  yard?: {
    sqft: number;
  };
}
            
function printYardSize(house: House) {
  const yardSize = house.yard?.sqft;

  if (yardSize === undefined) {
    console.log('No yard');
  } else {
    console.log(`Yard is ${yardSize} sqft`);
  }
}
            
let home: House = {
  sqft: 500
};
            
printYardSize(home); // Prints 'No yard'

Console :-
No yard


Example 2

interface House {
  sqft: number;
  yard?: {
    sqft: number;
  };
}
            
function printYardSize(house: House) {
  const yardSize = house.yard?.sqft;

  if (yardSize === undefined) {
    console.log('No yard');
  } else {
    console.log(`Yard is ${yardSize} sqft`);
  }
}
            
let house: House = {
  sqft: 500,
  yard: {
  	sqft: 900
  }
};
            
printYardSize(house); 

Console :-
Yard is 900 sqft

Nullish Coalescence ---------------------------------------------------------------v--
Nullish Coalescence is another JavaScript feature that also works well with TypeScript's null handling. 
It allows writing expressions that have a fallback specifically when dealing with null or undefined. 
This is useful when other falsy values can occur in the expression but are still valid. It can be used with the ?? operator in an expression, similar to using the && operator.

Example

function printMileage(mileage: number | null | undefined) {
  console.log(`Mileage: ${mileage ?? 'Not Available'}`);
}
            
printMileage(null); // Prints 'Mileage: Not Available'

printMileage(0); // Prints 'Mileage: 0'

Console :-
Mileage: Not Available
Mileage: 0

Null Assertion -------------------------------------------------------------------v--
TypeScript's inference system isn't perfect, there are times when it makes sense to ignore a value's possibility of being null or undefined. 
An easy way to do this is to use casting, but TypeScript also provides the ! operator as a convenient shortcut.

Example

function getValue(): string | undefined {
  return 'hello';
}
            
let value = getValue();
console.log('value length: ' + value!.length);

Console :-
value length: 5

**----- Just like casting, this can be unsafe and should be used with care. -----**

Array bounds handling ------------------------------------------------------------v--
Even with strictNullChecks enabled, by default TypeScript will assume array access will never return undefined (unless undefined is part of the array type).
The config noUncheckedIndexedAccess can be used to change this behavior.

Example
let array: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let value = array[0]; // with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` this has the type `number | undefined`

> > TypeScript Definitely Typed

NPM packages in the broad JavaScript ecosystem doesn't always have types available.
Sometimes the projects are no longer maintained, and other times they aren't interested in, agree with, or have time to use TypeScript.

Using non-typed NPM packages in TypeScript ---------------------------------------v--
Using untyped NPM packages with TypeScript will not be type safe due to lack of types.
To help TypeScript developers use such packages, there is a community maintained project called Definitely Typed.
Definitely Typed is a project that provides a central repository of TypeScript definitions for NPM packages which do not have types.

Example

npm install --save-dev @types/jquery

No other steps are usually needed to use the types after installing the declaration package, 
TypeScript will automatically pick up the types when using the package itself.

**----- Editors such as Visual Studio Code will often suggest installing packages like these when types are missing. -----**

> > TypeScript 5.x Updates

TypeScript is actively maintained and updated by Microsoft. In version 5.x a lot of utility and quality of life updates were made.
This chapter covers the most popular updates to allow stricter and more flexible type safety.

**----- As a reminder these features will only be available in 5.x+ -----**

Template Literal Types ------------------------------------------------------------v--
Template Literal Types now allows us to create more precise types using template literals. 
We can define custom types that depend on the actual values of strings at compile time.

Example

type Color = "red" | "green" | "blue"; 
type HexColor<T extends Color> = `#${string}`;

// Usage
let myColor: HexColor<"blue"> = "#0000FF";

console.log(myColor)

Console :-
#0000FF

Index Signature Labels ------------------------------------------------------------v--
Index Signature Labels allows us to label index signatures using computed property names. 
It helps in providing more descriptive type information when working with dynamic objects.

Example

type DynamicObject = { [key: string as `dynamic_${string}`]: string };

// Usage: 
let obj: DynamicObject = { dynamic_key: "value" };

console.log(obj);

Console :-
{ dynamic_key: "value" }


**----- 5.x also now supports native JavaScript private fields. 
The TypeScript 'private' still works as discussed in Classes section.-----**
